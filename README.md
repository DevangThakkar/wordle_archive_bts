# BTS-RKive: An RKive for Wordle-BTS

ðŸ”— https://www.devangthakkar.com/wordle_archive_bts/

BTS-RKive is an archive for [Wordle-BTS](https://bts-wordle.vercel.app/) by [BTSCHARTDATA](https://twitter.com/btschartdata)+[hannahcode](https://github.com/hannahcode/GAME) and built on top of my original [Wordle Archive](https://www.devangthakkar.com/wordle_archive/). I created this because [@malvikonga](https://twitter.com/malvikonga) asked for it.

## Rules

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word.
Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, purple, or yellow.

- Purple: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
